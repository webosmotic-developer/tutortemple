I taught Math and Computer Science for elementary and middle school children. I use different teaching methods depending on the academic background like above average students should be given questions based on higher order thinking skills, average students should be given regular practice and for slow learners conduct different activities so that they show interest in subject. I use different teaching methods depending on the concepts also.I feel a good tutor will use a comprehensive, baseline assessment to determine what skills are missing. Then the program should be structured to accomplish two things: teach those skills to your child over time so that the gaps are filled and provide ongoing support so that the child can pass their math class. Since no two children are alike, the plan should be customized to meet the childs exact needs. An effective tutoring program not only teaches the core skills that your child needs, it also has built in assessments that track the childs progress and check for mastery, not just competence. Mastering these key skills means that the child wont get stuck in the math when they start doing higher level problems. A good tutoring program will ultimately help your child master the skills that he needs to continue on his own without extra help. My hobbies are reading books , engage my daughter in different activities like drawing , craft , sports etc",
